**Abstract:** In this paper, we examine attributes predictive of account suspension in a pro-People's Republic of China (PRC) information operation on Twitter. We find, contrary to previous research, that in this campaign, including text as a feature, across a variety of BERT-based models and architectures, resulted in poor or decreased predictive performance. We find that the account metadata features played a much stronger role in account suspension prediction than the text of tweets. This case-study flags some of the potential limitations of AI systems in detecting malign activity on Twitter and highlights the importance of metadata in identifying influence operations.
